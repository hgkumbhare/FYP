For running binarised-model of moses:
Then make a copy of the ~/working/mert-work/moses.ini in the binarised-model directory
and change the phrase and reordering tables to point to the binarised versions, as follows:
1. Change PhraseDictionaryMemory to PhraseDictionaryCompact
2. Set the path of the PhraseDictionary feature to point to $HOME/working/binarised-model/phrase-table
3. Set the path of the LexicalReordering feature to point to $HOME/working/binarised-model/reordering-table

Run on terminal:
~/mosesdecoder/bin/moses -f ~/working/binarised-model/moses.ini

Note: For now we are not using binarized-model
